# Jose's stuff
To share different projects I am working on

You can find the UCSD stuff in Cisco communities here (since GitHub is apparently not the ideal tool to share UCSD workflows):
- REST API custom tasks: https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-58159
- Openstack custom tasks: https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-58158
