# Jose's stuff
To share different projects I am working on

cpu_monitor.py: this is a Python script that autoscales up and down a Web farm, adding the new VMs to the F5 BigIP server pool using ACI's API


<b>json2doc.py</b>: converts ACI tenant config in JSON (can be generated with the Save As function in the GUI) in a Word document including diagrams

You can find the UCSD stuff in Cisco communities here (since GitHub is apparently not the ideal tool to share UCSD workflows):
- REST API custom tasks: https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-58159
- Openstack custom tasks: https://communities.cisco.com/docs/DOC-58158
